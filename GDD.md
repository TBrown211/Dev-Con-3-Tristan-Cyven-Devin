### Overview:
We decided to make a game revolving around defending your base with a cannon from incoming boulders rolling down a hill. The player will have to last for as long as they can against the onslaught of boulders by shooting them with their cannon to move them back up the hill. The player can move left and right to better position themselves to shoot the boulders and will have three health points before their base is destroyed. The boulders will spawn at random intervals across the top of the hill. 
### Objective Statement:
We wanted to see how fast-moving projectiles would interact with moving hazards and how the player might be able to use that interaction to their advantage. We thought that it would be interesting to see what would happen when two physic objects collided with each other at high speed and how that could create fun gameplay moments for the player. 
### Design Rational:
We envision a game where the players will chaotically try to defend themselves as more and more boulders make their way toward them. We hope that the physics interactions between the cannon balls and the boulders will create some interesting results. The main idea is to have the player constantly trying to move the boulders uphill with an unconventional method. The game will have metrics assigned to both the cannonballs and the boulders to determine how they will behave with Unity’s physics engine. 
Metric Research and References:
We will primarily be using the metrics of how real-life cannonballs are fired and trying to simulate that in our prototype. Based on how the cannonballs feel to fire, we will adjust to see if the cannonball’s physics should be more realistic or less.
### Inspiration: 
Our game is an inspired mixture of the Barrel shoot mini-game from The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker ([Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0vKfn5bmI)) and The Game of Sisyphus ([Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEXhbcIOplQ)) 
### Feedback:
-	We should have the boulders be of random sizes with smaller boulders being lighter and bigger boulders being heavier. 
-	We could have a system where the player gets more points based on keeping the boulder up the hill as long as possible.
-	Make use of a Pirate theme
-	Have a system that could press the fire button rapidly for faster shots or hold the button down for a power shot.
